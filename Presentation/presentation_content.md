## Slide 1: Title Slide
*   **Visual:** Project Title "Mastering the AI Toolkit", Group Members' Names, University/Course Name. High-quality background image of a neural network or code.
*   **Script (Speaker 1):** "Hello everyone. We are [Group Name], and today we present our project 'Mastering the AI Toolkit'. We explored the power of TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and spaCy to solve real-world AI problems."

## Slide 2: Theoretical Foundations
*   **Visual:** Split screen showing logos of TensorFlow vs. PyTorch, and a bullet point list for Scikit-learn.
*   **Script (Speaker 1):** "We started by analyzing the theoretical landscape. We compared the dynamic nature of PyTorch with the production-readiness of TensorFlow. We also established that while Scikit-learn is the go-to for classical ML, deep learning frameworks are essential for complex tasks like image recognition."

## Slide 3: Practical Task 1 - Classical ML (Iris)
*   **Visual:** Screenshot of the Decision Tree code snippet and the Classification Report (Precision/Recall scores).
*   **Script (Speaker 2):** "For our first practical task, we used Scikit-learn on the Iris dataset. We successfully trained a Decision Tree classifier. As you can see from our results, we achieved high accuracy, demonstrating how effective classical algorithms are for structured data."

## Slide 4: Practical Task 2 - Deep Learning (MNIST)
*   **Visual:** The CNN architecture diagram (or `model.summary()` screenshot) and the grid of 5 predicted digit images.
*   **Script (Speaker 2):** "Next, we tackled Computer Vision using TensorFlow. We built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset. Our model achieved over 98% accuracy. Here are some sample predictions showing the model correctly identifying handwritten digits."

## Slide 5: Practical Task 3 - NLP (Amazon Reviews)
*   **Visual:** Screenshot of the spaCy NER output (highlighting product names) and a few sentiment scores.
*   **Script (Speaker 3):** "Moving to NLP, we utilized spaCy to analyze Amazon reviews. We performed Named Entity Recognition to extract product brands and implemented a rule-based sentiment analyzer to classify feedback as positive or negative, showcasing the power of linguistic processing."

## Slide 6: Ethics & Optimization
*   **Visual:** Icons representing 'Bias' and 'Fairness'. A snippet of the 'Fixed' code vs 'Buggy' code.
*   **Script (Speaker 3):** "We didn't just build models; we analyzed them. We discussed potential biases in our datasets, such as geographic bias in handwriting. We also debugged a broken TensorFlow script, fixing critical dimension mismatches to ensure robust model training."

## Slide 7: Bonus - Deployment & Conclusion
*   **Visual:** A screen recording or screenshot of the Streamlit Web App in action.
*   **Script (All/Speaker 1):** "Finally, we went the extra mile and deployed our MNIST model using Streamlit, creating a user-friendly web interface. This project solidified our understanding of the entire AI pipeline—from theory to deployment. Thank you!"
